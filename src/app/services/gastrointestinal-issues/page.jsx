          <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4 text-sm md:text-base">
            Good gastrointestinal (GI) health is essential for digestion,
            nutrient absorption, and overall well-being. Proper care helps
            prevent issues like acid reflux, ulcers, IBS, and chronic digestive
            disorders. Managing GI health reduces discomfort, improves energy
            levels, and supports a strong immune system. Early detection of
            conditions like colon disease can prevent serious complications. A
            healthy gut leads to better digestion, improved metabolism, and
            overall wellness. Taking care of your digestive system ensures
            long-term health and vitality!
